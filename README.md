📚E-LEARNING PLATFORM UI- PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

This project is a front-end–only **E-Learning Platform User Interface** designed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a modern e-learning interface can be built with a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and interactive features without relying on any backend technologies. The platform focuses entirely on the user experience and visual structure that would typically exist in a real-world online learning application.

The application is implemented as a **multi-page interface**, allowing users to seamlessly move between different sections such as course listings, individual course pages, and progress tracking views. Each page is styled consistently to maintain a professional and user-friendly design. The project was developed using Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor and version control was maintained using Git and GitHub.

### Course Listing (Card-Based Layout)

The homepage displays available courses using a **card-based layout**, a common UI pattern used in modern learning platforms. Each course card includes a course title, a brief description, and an action button that allows users to navigate to the respective course page. This approach improves readability, keeps the interface visually organized, and makes it easy for users to browse multiple courses at a glance.

The card layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Embedded Video Lessons

Each course page includes **embedded video lessons** using iframe-based video integration. This allows learners to watch educational content directly within the platform without being redirected to external websites. Video embedding enhances engagement and reflects how real e-learning systems deliver instructional material. The video section is positioned clearly within the course page layout, making it accessible and easy to use.

### Progress Tracking Using LocalStorage

User progress is tracked using **browser LocalStorage**, enabling the platform to remember completion status without backend support. When a user completes a lesson, their progress is stored locally and reflected in the progress page. This feature demonstrates how client-side storage can be used to simulate real progress tracking in UI-focused applications.

### Styled UI with Responsive Layout

The platform uses custom **CSS styling** to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface. Colors, spacing, typography, and layout are carefully chosen to enhance readability and usability. Responsive design techniques such as flexible containers and scalable elements ensure the UI functions correctly across different devices and screen resolutions.

### Multi-Page Navigation

The project follows a **multi-page navigation structure**, with separate HTML files for different sections of the platform. Navigation links allow users to move smoothly between pages, closely mimicking the structure of a real e-learning website. This design approach helps demonstrate an understanding of front-end architecture and UI flow.

Overall, this project serves as a strong foundation for an e-learning interface and can be extended with backend integration, authentication, quizzes, and certificates in the future.
